        This document specifies a mechanism for exposing to a screen-capturing application mouse
        events which occur over a captured [=display surface=].

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Web applications can use {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} to capture any [=display
        surface=] - <a data-cite="screen-capture/#dfn-browser">tabs</a>,
        <a data-cite="screen-capture/#dfn-window">windows</a> or
        <a data-cite="screen-capture/#dfn-monitor">screens</a>. When they do, they can also specify
        the <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-cursor">cursor</a> constraint to control whether the
        cursor's pixels are captured or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if the application wishes to programmatically observe the location of the cursor?
        That can be done by scanning each frame and employing heuristics to detect the cursor. But
        that's neither simple, nor efficient, nor robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mechanism for exposing mouse coordinates over a captured surface to a capturing
        application is desirable.

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <section id="use-case-1">
        <h3>Use case #1: Cursor enhancement</h3>
        <p>
          During video-conferencing calls, Web applications on the receiving side can use our
          mechanism to highlight, enhance or outright replace the cursor. This can be done without
          making such distracting adjustments on the capturing side, where the presenter might not
          need such aids.
        </p>
        <p>This same can be done when recording an instructional video.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="use-case-2">
        <h3>Use case #2: Efficiency enhancements during RTC</h3>
        <p>
          Captured frames are often encoded and then transmitted remotely. Updates to the cursor
          location require a new frame to be encoded and transmitted, costing CPU, power and
          bandwidth. In theory, these costs could be minimized by efficient encoding; in practice,
          the costs are non-negligible - the entire image needs to be scanned for changes, and there
          is per-frame IPC overhead which multiplies with the max framerate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If mouse coordinates were known to the encoding application, it could transmit these
          coordinates to the receiving application (on another device). The receiver could then
          redraw a cursor on the other side. (Note that, depending on the decoder, this is likely
          cheaper than decoding a whole new frame.) Non-trivial complexity would be added, but the
          gains to CPU, power and bandwidth on both sides might justify it.

      <h2>CapturedMouseEvent interface</h2>
      <p>
        We define a new event type, {{CapturedMouseEvent}}. This is modelled after {{MouseEvent}}
        from [[UIEVENTS]], but exposes less information. Whereas {{MouseEvent}} exposes to an
        application the user's interaction with the application itself, and is therefore
        straightforward security-wise, {{CapturedMouseEvent}} exposes to an application the user's
        interaction with another application, or even with the operating system itself, calling for
        more scrutiny in which information may safely be exposed. At present, only information
        already available to the capturing application is exposed - the mouse coordinates.

          constructor(DOMString type, optional CapturedMouseEventInit eventInitDict = {});
